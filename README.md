## Overview of training process
1. Download PDB data
2. Process PDB data
3. Generate OmegaFold Embeddings on processed pdb data
4. Train on those embeddings

## The Model (Harmonic Diffusion)
Structure graph G = (V, E) where G represents a protein with a specific sequence, V is the set of residues and E the edges connecting neighboring residues.
The model learns G-dependent probability distributions under a forward diffusion process:

dx = âˆ’1/2Hxdt + dw

x are the coordinates of the alpha carbons and H is chosen such that undesired, chemically implausible structures have high energy E(x):
